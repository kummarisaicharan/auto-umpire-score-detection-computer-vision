## Auto Cricket Umpire Score detection based on pose estimation in computer vision

This project uses *openc-cv* library in addition to 
mathematical analysis of the cricket umpire gestures 
feeded in to the vision system to accurately detect the 
score based on the position of the human pose with 
respect to the frame of reference.

1.  The system should be calibrated before had to match 
the precision of the human umpire.
2.  Proper lighting should used to get pose-estimation to 
work.
3.  The best results are observed when the foregrounf 
background "RGB" color profiles should be distinct.

> Note: This project is an experimental analysis and no 
where near to the production grade product.
